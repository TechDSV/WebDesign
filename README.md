# Step by step of Web Design Process

Almost every Web designer can attest that much of their work is repetitive. We find ourselves completing the same tasks, even if slightly modified, over and over for every Web project. A Web development process is a documented outline of the steps needed to be taken from start to finish in order to complete a typical Web design project.

This article tries to show how developing a [web design process](https://www.designveloper.com/en/blog/web-design-process/) can organize a developer’s thoughts, speed up a project’s timeline and prepare a freelance business for growth.

## What exactly is a ‘process’?

A Web development process is a documented outline of the steps needed to be taken from start to finish in order to complete a typical Web design project.

It divides and categorizes the work and then breaks these high-level sections into tasks and resources that can be used as a road map for each project. Here is a standard process that was put together using examples from around the Web as well as my own experience.

## 1. Planning

The planning stage is arguably the most important, because what’s decided and mapped here sets the stage for the entire project. It’s also the stage that requires client interaction and the accompanying attention to detail.

* **Determine required software and resources.** Beyond determining any third-party media needs, identify where you may need to hire subcontractors and any additional software you may personally require.
* **Gain access to servers and build folder structure.** Typical information to obtain and validate includes FTP host, username and password; control panel log-in information and database configuration.
* **Contracts that define roles, copyright and financial points.** This is a crucial element of the documentation and should include payment terms, project closure clauses, termination clauses, copyright ownership and timelines.
* **Site map.** A site map guides end users who are lost in the structure or need to find a piece of information quickly.
* **Project charter.** The project charter sums up the information that has been gathered and agreed upon in the previous point.
* Requirements analysis. This includes client goals, target audience, detailed feature requests and as much relevant information as you can possibly gather.

## 2. Design

The design stage typically involves moving the information outlined in the planning stage further into reality. The main deliverables are a documented site structure and, more importantly, a visual representation.

* **Slice and code valid XHTML/CSS It’s coding time.** Slice the final Photoshop mock-up, and write the HTML and CSS code for the basic design.
* **Review and approval cycle.** A cycle of reviewing, tweaking and approving the mock-ups often takes place until (ideally) both client and contractor are satisfied with the design.
* **Mock-ups based on requirements analysis.** Designing mock-ups in Photoshop allows for relatively easy modification.
* **Wireframe and design elements planning.** This is where the visual layout of the website begins to take shape.

## 3. Development

Development involves the bulk of the programming work, as well as loading content. Keep code organized and commented, and refer constantly to the planning details as the full website takes shape.

* **Test and verify links and functionality.** This is a good time for a full website review. Using your file manager as a guide, walk through every single page you’ve created.
* **Fill with content.** Time for the boring part: loading all of the content provided by the client or writer.
* **Develop and test special features and interactivity.** Here’s where the fancy elements come into play.
* **Code templates for each page type.** A website usually has several pages that can be based on templates.
* **Build development framework.** This is when unique requirements might force you to diverge from the process.

## 4. Launch

An important early step in this phase is to move the website, if need be, to its permanent Web server. The purpose of the launch phase is to prepare the website for public viewing. This requires final polishing of design elements, deep testing of interactivity and features and, most of all, a consideration of the user experience.

* **Final cross-browser check.** Don’t forget to check the website in multiple browsers one last time.
* **Testing.** Run the website through the final diagnostics using the available tools: code validators, broken-link checkers, website health checks, spell-checker and the like.
* **Transfer to live server.** This could mean transferring to a live Web server, “unhiding” the website or removing the “Under construction” page.
* **Polishing.** Particularly if you’re not scrambling to meet the deadline, polishing a basically completed design can make a big difference.

## 5. Post-Launch

Packaging source files, providing instructions for use and any required training occurs at this time. Business re-enters the picture at this point as you take care of all the little tasks related to closing the project. Don’t leave the project with a closed door; communicate that you’re available for future maintenance and are committed to ongoing support.

* **Project close, final documentation.** Get the client to sign off on the last checks, provide your contact information for support, and officially close the project.
* **Provide documentation and source files.** Provide documentation for the website, such as a soft-copy site map and details on the framework and languages used.
* **Hand off to the client.** Be sure the client is satisfied with the product and that all contractual obligations have been met.
